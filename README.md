# Retinal-optical-coherence-tomography-
This repository contains a CNN model for retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) image classification. The model is trained on an OCT dataset to distinguish between different retinal conditions. The architectures used for this implementation are VGG16 and AlexNet, both of which deep learning models for image classification.
